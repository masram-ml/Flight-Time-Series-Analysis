# Flight Time Series Analysis

## Overview

 This Python code analyzes a time series dataset of flight passengers, aiming to understand the trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data. The analysis includes visualizations, decomposition techniques, stationarity tests, detrending, autocorrelation analysis, and building a SARIMAX model for predicting future passenger counts.  The dataset contains information about the number of passengers across different months and years. The code systematically explores various aspects of the time series data to derive insights and make predictions.

## Data Preparation and Visualization

The initial section of the code involves loading and preprocessing the time series data. The dataset is then visualized to understand the seasonal patterns and trends.

## Functions

The code includes several functions to perform specific tasks, including plotting seasonal data, performing seasonal decomposition, conducting stationarity tests, detrending, autocorrelation analysis, and building a SARIMAX model.

## Load and Preprocess Data

The `load_and_preprocess_data` function loads the dataset, which is then preprocessed for further analysis.

## Seasonal Plot

The `plot_seasonal_data` function generates a seasonal plot of the flight time series data.

## Seasonal Decomposition

The `seasonal_decomposition` function performs seasonal decomposition using the statsmodels library.

## Stationarity Tests

The `stationarity_tests` function conducts Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests to check for stationarity.

## Detrending

The `detrend_and_check_stationarity` function detrends the time series data and performs stationarity tests on the detrended series.

## Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation

The `acf_pacf_analysis` function calculates and plots the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).

## SARIMAX Model

The `sarimax_model_and_prediction` function builds a SARIMAX model and makes predictions for future values.
